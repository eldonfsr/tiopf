Hi all,

After working with the DevExpress mediators on our own projects, I started again from scratch to implement the mediators for the general public.

Enclosed you will find a first version. The main file is tiDeMediators.pas which is largely based on the tiMediators.pas in the GUI\VCL folder.

There is still a lot to do, only mediators for a few control classes have been implemented so far. The difficult part will be the implementation of the mediator for the grid (we want the user to be able to edit directly in the grid). I will work on that in the near future.

In the zipfile there is also a sample project that tests / demonstrates all available mediators.

The last thing I added is a screenshot one of our applications that uses DevExpress controls incl the layout control and skins.

Anybody that uses the DevExpress controls with tiOPF: please have a look and let me know your comments!

With kind regards,
