I almost forgot this, but anyway, here goes... 

A generic DBExpress and (working, though not very thoroughly tested)
PostgreSQL (using the VitaVoom dbExpress driver ->
http://www.vitavoom.com) layer for tiOPF2. I'll try to add a MySQL and
Interbase/Firebird implementation too (which should be ready by the
end of september - since I'll be on holiday then :p).

I'll see if I can create some DUnit tests too (I've never done it).

BTW Only modified/new files are inside the ZIPs (one for the core, one
for the demos). Enjoy!

Kind regards,

Wim Vandersmissen
