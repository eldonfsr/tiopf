 These are the scripts I use on my Linux build server
 located at opensoft.homeip.net

 They serve as a backup and is not really designed for someone else to
 use. They are specific to my setup and path locations, but should be
 easy to customise if someone else wanted to use them.

 Regards,
   Graeme.
