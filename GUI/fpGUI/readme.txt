GUI support for tiOPF with fpGUI Toolkit
----------------------------------------
These units were moved from the fpGUI repository to tiOPF repository. They
seem more appropriate in this new location.

About fpGUI Toolkit
-------------------
fpGUI toolkit is intended for Open Source and Commercial applications.
fpGUI uses the LGPL 2 license with a static linking exception - the
same as the Free Pascal Compiler's RTL.

fpGUI is a Object Pascal toolkit for cross-platfrom applications
development. It is designed for the Free Pascal Compiler. It provides
single-source portability across Linux, MS Windows, *BSD and embedded
operating systems like Embedded Linux and Windows CE. It is a
complete custom drawn toolkit, so you get a consistent look and behaviour on
all supported platforms. This also reduces the library dependency, making
application deployment very easy.
