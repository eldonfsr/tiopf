  Model-GUI-Mediator (MGM) pattern implementation by Graeme Geldenhuys
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

This allows standard controls or any other GUI controls for that matter to become
object-aware.  The benefits are much greater ease in cross platform development, 
or if you would like to make your favorite set of GUI controls object-aware.

Please note this is work in progress...
So far I have implemented most used basic edit controls:
     TfpgEdit
     TfpgSpinEdit    (dependend on fpGUI component)
     TfpgLabel
     TfpgComboBox    (single and list property)
     TfpgTrackBar
     TfpgMemo
     TfpgListView    (includes popup menu)
     TfpgListBox     (includes popup menu)
     TfpgCheckBox
     TfpgCalendarCombo
     TfpgCalendarCheckCombo
     TfpgStringGrid

Currently I am considering implementing the container classes like TfpgTreeView.
They are quite complex and there are multiple ways of implementing them.
