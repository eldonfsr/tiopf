MastApp tiOPF

This is a port of the MastApp delphi demo to tiOPF.  It was compiled with Delphi 2007, so earlier versions will get errors openning the forms.  These errors can be resolved by resaving the forms.

COMPILATION
The locations of some of the files referenced in the app will need to be corrected (FtiPerEditDialog).

TiDataset is required, although it does not need to be isntalled into delphi, just on the path.  It is in \Required\TiDataset

I have included dbdemos.mdb.  I have also included dbdemos.gdb if anyone wants to try changing to Interbase.
